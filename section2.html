    <h3 class="measurements">Note that 100% accurate measurements should be conducted by professionals. <a href="https://tdeecalculator.net">This website</a> can help calculate all of the measurements provided.</h3>
    <h2 class="BMI">Importance of Body Data & Measurements</h2>
    <p class="BMI">Body measurements primarily exist to tell you how your body is; tall, short, underweight, overweight, thin, wide, ect. Though it might not seem that important to others, it is important </p>
    <h2 class="BMI">Body Mass Index (BMI)</h2>
    <p class="BMI">The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a BMI is a way to measure if one is thin or obese/fat by comparing one’s weight with their height. The BMI is calculated by dividing one’s weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters. Ideally, a healthy BMI is between 18.5 to 24.9.</p>
    <p class="formula">The BMI is calculated using the formula:</p>
    <p class="BMI">BMI = weight (kg) / height (m)<sup>2</sup></p>
    <img src="img/bmi.png" alt="BMI" class="BMI" width="512" height="396">
    <p class="BMI">Limitations: BMI is only an estimate that cannot take body composition into account. Due to a wide variety of body types as well as distribution of muscle, bone mass, and fat, BMI should be considered along with other measurements rather than being used as the sole method for determining a person's healthy body weight. BMI is further influenced by factors such as age, sex, ethnicity, muscle mass, body fat, and activity level, among others.</p>
    <h2 class="BMR">Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)</h2>
    <p class="BMR">The Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is the number of calories that your body needs to maintain basic physiological functions at rest. It is the minimum amount of energy required to keep your body functioning while you are not doing any physical activities. Your diets total calories are directly related to your basal metabolic rate as the macros of your meals should (usually) match your BMR (and weight gaining and loosing meals go up and down according to your BMR).</p>
    <p class ="BMR">Macros (Macronutrients): Macros refers to the three most used nutrients that we use at the highest amounts (Carbohydrates, Fats, Proteins) which are also the ones we rely most on keeping our body functioning. </p>
    <p class="BMR">Calorie: a unit of energy (consumed/burned by humans).</p>
    <p class="formula">The BMR is calculated using the formula:</p>
    <p class="formula">Harris-Benedict Formula (Lean Body Mass not provided):</p>
    <p class="BMR">Men: BMR = 66.5 + (13.75 × weight in kg) + (5.003 × height in cm) - (6.75 × age)</p>
    <p class="BMR">Women: BMR = 655.1 + (9.563 × weight in kg) + (1.850 × height in cm) - (4.676 × age)</p>
    <p class="formula">Katch-McArdle Formula (Lean Body Mass provided):</p>
    <p class="BMR">BMR = 370 + (21.6 × Lean Body Mass in kg)</p>
    <p class="BMR">Lean Body Mass: Lean body mass is the weight of everything in the body except fat. It includes muscle, bone, organs, and water. It is important to note that lean body mass does not include fat tissue.</p>
    <p class="BMR">Lean Body Mass (LBM) is calculated using the formula:</p>
    <p class="BMR">LBM = weight (kg) × (1 - body fat percentage)</p>
    <p class="BMR">Limitations: BMR is only an estimate that cannot take body composition into account. Due to a wide variety of body types as well as distribution of muscle, bone mass, and fat, BMR should be considered along with other measurements rather than being used as the sole method for determining a person's healthy body weight. BMR is further influenced by factors such as age.</p></body>
    <h2 class="BMR">Ideal Body Weight</h2>
    <p class="BMR">Ideal body weight is the weight that is considered to be healthy for a person based on their height and body composition. It is important to note that ideal body weight is not the same as a healthy weight, as it does not take into account factors such as muscle mass, bone density, and body fat percentage.</p>
    <ul class="BMR">Ideal body weight is calculated using these formulae:</p>
    <li class="BMR">G. J. Hamwi Formula (1964): Male: 48.0 kg + 2.7 kg per inch over 5 feet Female: 45.5 kg + 2.2 kg per inch over 5 feet</li>
    <li class="BMR">B. J. Devine Formula (1974): Male: 50.0 kg + 2.3 kg per inch over 5 feet Female: 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg per inch over 5 feet</li>
    <li class="BMR">M. J. Robinson Formula (1983): Male: 52 kg + 1.9 kg per inch over 5 feet Female: 49 kg + 1.7 kg per inch over 5 feet</li>
    <li class="BMR">D. R. Miller Formula (1983): Male: 56.2 kg + 1.41 kg per inch over 5 feet Female: 53.1 kg + 1.36 kg per inch over 5 feet</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Maximum Muscular Potential</h2>
    <p class="BMR">Maximum muscular potential is the maximum amount of muscle mass that a person can achieve based on their body type and genetics. It is important to note that maximum muscular potential is not the same as ideal body weight, as it does not take into account factors such as body fat percentage and overall health.</p>
    <p class="BMR">Maximum muscular potential is calculated using the formula:</p>
    <p class="BMR">Maximum Muscular Potential = (body weight in kg × 0.9) + 10</p>
    <p>Maximum Muscular Potential at 5-6% (ripped) body fat: (Height cm - 100) = Body weight in kg</p>
    <p class="BMR">Limitations: Maximum muscular potential is only an estimate that cannot take body composition into account. Due to a wide variety of body types as well as distribution of muscle, bone mass, and fat, maximum muscular potential should be considered along with other measurements rather than being used as the sole method for determining a person's healthy body weight. Maximum muscular potential is further influenced by factors
    <h2 class="others">Other Measurements</h2>
    <p class="BMR">Body Fat Percentage: Body fat percentage is the percentage of your total body weight that is made up of fat. It is an important measure of body composition and can help assess overall health and fitness.</p>
    <p class="BMR">Body Fat Percentage is calculated using the formula: Body Fat Percentage = (fat mass / total body weight) × 100</p>
    <p class="BMR"><br>Fat Mass: Fat mass is the total amount of fat in the body, including both essential fat and storage fat. Essential fat is necessary for normal physiological function, while storage fat is excess fat that can be used for energy.</p>
    <p class="BMR">Fat Mass is calculated using the formula: Fat Mass = total body weight × body fat percentage</p>
    <p class="BMR">Limitations: Body fat percentage is only an estimate that cannot take body composition into account. Due to a wide variety of body types as well as distribution of muscle, bone mass, and fat, body fat percentage should be considered along with other measurements rather than being used as the sole method for determining a person's healthy body weight.</p>
    <p class="BMR"><br>Waist-to-Hip Ratio: The waist-to-hip ratio is a measure of the distribution of body fat. It is calculated by dividing the circumference of the waist by the circumference of the hips. A higher ratio indicates a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and other health problems.</p>
    <p class="BMR">Waist-to-Hip Ratio is calculated using the formula: Waist-to-Hip Ratio = waist circumference / hip circumference</p>
    <p class="BMR">Limitations: Waist-to-hip ratio is only an estimate that cannot take body composition into account. Due to a wide variety of body types as well as distribution of muscle, bone mass, and fat, waist-to-hip ratio should be considered along with other measurements rather than being used as the sole method for determining a person's healthy body weight.</p>
