        <h2>Dieting</h2>
        <p>As one of the major factors of being physically fit, a staple diet can heavily influence the effects and results of training. The amount and quality of foods and nutrients can heavily impact your physical health, positively or negatively. Dieting is the practice of eating food in a regulated fashion to achieve or maintain a specific weight or health goal. It can involve various strategies, including calorie restriction, macronutrient manipulation, and meal timing. A diet's meals are dependent on how much calories and macros (carbs, fat, protein) you wish to consume per day and the type of diet you want to do. So it's important for a person who wants to start dieting to try each type of diet until you found one that you like and feel comfortable doing for long periods of time.</p>
        <h3>Types of Diets</h3>
        <ul class="diet-types">
            <li>Bodybuilding: Protein is your main focus and so is managing the calories you eat to control fat gain. When cutting, you eat less, and when bulking, you eat more (or replace same things with higher calorie options).</li>
            <li>Intermittent fasting: You eat in a specific time period (for instance, 8:16 means you eat in a 8-hour period and fast for the other 16 hours) and you fast for the rest.
            </li>
            <li>Ketogenic (Keto): A high fat low carb diet aimed to induce ketosis, where your body used ketogenics as energy instead of carbs. (Sometimes 0 carbs)
            </li>
            <li>Carnivore Diet: A diet that consists entirely of animal products, like meats, milk, cheese, etc. Not very effective in vitamins, minerals and fiber.
            </li>
            <li>Mediterranean: Inspired by the diets of Mediterranean areas. Emphasizes whole foods, healthy fats (like olive oil), fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins with not many processed foods (essentially what we think of as a healthy diet)..
            </li>
            <li>Paleo: This diet focuses on eating foods that were presumably available to our ancestors (lean meats, fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds, avoiding processed foods, grains, dairy, etc).
            </li>
            <li>Vegan Diet: Eat foods that are not animal related, eating mainly fruits and vegetables. Not very effective in protein intake and certain minerals.
            </li>
            <li>If It Fits Your Macros (IIFYM): Eating whatever you want as long as it fits your macros.
            </li>
            <li>Flexitarian: A flexible vegetarian diet that allows for occasional meat and fish consumption.
            </li>
            <li>Low-Carb: A diet that restricts carbohydrates, focusing on protein and healthy fats.
            </li>
            <li>Low-FODMAP: A diet that restricts certain carbohydrates that can cause digestive issues.
            </li>
            <li>Gluten-Free: A diet that excludes gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye.
            </li>
            <li>Whole30: A 30-day program that eliminates sugar, grains, dairy, and legumes to reset eating habits.
            </li>
            <li>Raw Food: A diet that consists of uncooked and unprocessed foods, primarily fruits and vegetables.
            </li>
            <li>Dash Diet: A diet designed to combat high blood pressure, focusing on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
            </li>
            <li>Zone Diet: A diet that emphasizes a balance of macronutrients (40% carbs, 30% protein, 30% fat) to control inflammation and promote health.
            </li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Meals</h3>
        <p>Everyday you should have at least three meals, but you could aim for 4-6 to properly supply your body with the nutrients you need and support your body’s protein synthesis. Meal timing can also play a role in optimizing performance and recovery. Consuming a meal or snack containing carbohydrates and protein before and after workouts can help fuel your body and support muscle recovery. The meals should be spaced out between 3-4 hours between meals which allows for a steady supply of nutrients to the muscles. For both athletes and bodybuilders, it is important to have an adequate amount of carbs, fat and protein to maximize muscle protein synthesis (grows muscle). So it’s either 3 larger meals or 4-6 smaller meals per day to stay fit. You should also have small meals pre workout and post workout to properly fuel your body. A proper meal plan for 4-6 meals would be like this (assuming the total calories per day is 2500 kcal):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Breakfast: 500 kcal</li>
            <li>Lunch: 600 kcal</li>
            <li>Snack: 300 kcal</li>
            <li>Pre-workout: 200 kcal</li>
            <li>Dinner: 700 kcal</li>
            <li>Post-workout: 200 kcal</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that the meals should be balanced and contain a mix of protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats. For example, a meal could include grilled chicken, brown rice, and steamed vegetables. However, though diets follow strict amounts of calories per meal, you should still make your meals have taste, either through low-calorie sauces, dressings or just use seasoning (with low counts of calories like paprika, salt, pepper, soy sauce, etc.) when you're cooking. This is completely optional for hardcore athletes or bodybuilders, but absolutely necessary for those who either can't continue a diet if it taste bad, or want to be excited about meals and eating food. It is also important to stay hydrated and drink plenty of water throughout the day. Aim for at least 8-10 cups of water daily (2-3 Litres), and more if you are physically active.</p>
        <h3>Benefits of Dieting</h3>
        <p>Dieting can lead to weight loss, improved metabolic health, and reduced risk of chronic diseases. However, it is important to approach dieting in a healthy and sustainable way.</p>

        <h3>Risks of Dieting</h3>
        <p>Extreme dieting can lead to nutrient deficiencies, muscle loss, and other health issues. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new diet plan.</p>
