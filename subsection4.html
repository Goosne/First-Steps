<h2 class="steroids">Anabolic Steroids</h2>
<p>This is for those who want to take physical activity, performance and strength to the extreme. Anabolic steroids are synthetic derivatives of testosterone, designed to promote muscle growth and enhance physical performance. In fitness, they are used to grow bigger muscles, go way off your natural limit and lift way heavier. Though it has all the dream positives you could ever imagine for the gym, the side effects are arguably worse and are permanent. You may experience mood swings, roid rage, liver and heart problems, becoming dependent and can’t withdraw and in males, also starts shrinking the size of your testicles (and sterility problems) and enlarged breasts. In females, you may experience changes to the menstrual cycle, deepening of the voice, lengthening of the clitoris, increased facial and body hair, shrinking breasts and increased sex drive. Diseases that can result from this include osteoperosis (weakening of the bones), Cushing's syndrome and high blood pressure. Being on steroids are expensive too, as either you continue taking steroids for years and years or give up on steroids but be on TRT (testosterone replacement therapy) for the rest of your life. Either way, it will cost you your money and potentially your health. Nonetheless, it's an amazing supplement for those who want the Mr Olympia physique or serious athletes and dedicators to fitness, and definitely not recommended at all for regular people.</p>
