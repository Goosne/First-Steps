    <h2>Meals</h2>
    <p class="meal">A meal is a specific instance of eating, typically consisting of a combination of foods and beverages. Meals can vary in size, composition, and timing, and they play a crucial role in providing the body with essential nutrients and energy. Meals can be categorized into different types, such as breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks. The content of a meal can vary widely based on cultural, dietary, and personal preferences. In a fitness context, you should always have at least 3 meals per day (breakfast, lunch, dinner), but if you can, 4-6 meals (breakfast, lunch, snack, pre-workout meal, post-workout meal, dinner, all in smaller portions. Snack, pre-workout and post-workout meals can go in between breakfast and lunch or lunch and dinner, sometimes post-workout meals go after dinner.) can maximize nutrition absorption, energy recovery and muscle protein synthesis.</p>
    <h2>Meal Types</h2>
    <ul class="meal-types">
        <li>Breakfast: The first meal of the day, typically eaten in the morning. It often includes foods like eggs, toast, cereal, fruits, and beverages like coffee or juice.</li>
        <li>Lunch: A midday meal that can vary widely in composition. It may include sandwiches, salads, soups, or leftovers from dinner.</li>
        <li>Dinner: The main meal of the day, usually eaten in the evening. It often includes a protein source (meat, fish, legumes), vegetables, and grains or starches.</li>
        <li>Snacks: Smaller meals or food items consumed between main meals. Snacks can include fruits, nuts, yogurt, or granola bars.</li>
        <li>Brunch: A combination of breakfast and lunch, typically eaten late in the morning or early afternoon. It often includes a mix of breakfast and lunch foods.</li>
        <li>Pre-workout meal: A meal consumed before exercise to provide energy and nutrients for performance. It may include carbohydrates and protein.</li>
        <li>Post-workout meal: A meal consumed after exercise to aid recovery and replenish glycogen stores. It often includes protein and carbohydrates.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Meal Timing</h2>
    <p class="meal">Meal timing refers to the schedule and frequency of meals throughout the day. It can vary based on individual preferences, lifestyle, and dietary goals. Some common meal timing strategies include:</p>
    <ul class="meal-timing">
        <li>Regular meal schedule: Eating meals at consistent times each day, such as three main meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner) and snacks in between.</li>
        <li>Intermittent fasting: A dietary approach that involves cycling between periods of eating and fasting. Common methods include the 16/8 method (16 hours of fasting and 8 hours of eating) and the 5:2 diet (eating normally for five days and restricting calories for two non-consecutive days).</li>
        <li>Frequent small meals: Eating smaller meals more frequently throughout the day, often referred to as "grazing." This approach can help stabilize blood sugar levels and provide a steady source of energy.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Meal Composition & Macro Ratios</h2>
    <p>Meal composition refers to the specific foods and nutrients included in a meal. A well-balanced meal typically includes a combination of macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, and fats) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals). The ideal composition of a meal can vary based on individual dietary goals, preferences, and activity levels. Macro ratio (or distribution ranges) means the amount of carbs, fat and protein that make up your daily calorie intake. Acceptable macro distribution ranges from 45-65% carbohydrates (if you do keto or carnivore diets, then you would have close to 0 carbs), 20-35% fat (for people over 4 years old) and 10-30% protein (up to 35% for people older than 18).</p>
    <p>For weight loss purposes (and all other general purposes of meals) a macronutrient distribution could consist of:</p>
    <ul class="meal-composition">
        <li>40% carbohydrates, 25% fat, 35% protein (recommended for weight loss)</li>
        <li>High carb low fat: 50% carbohydrates, 20% fat, 30% protein</li>
        <li>Moderate carb high fat: 30% carbohydrates, 40% fat, 30% protein</li>
        <li>Very low carb high fat: 20% carbohydrates, 40% fat, 40% protein</li>
        <li>10% carbohydrates, 60% fat, 30% protein (Keto)</li>
        <li>0% carbohydrates, 70% fat, 30% protein (Carnivore)</li>
        </ul>
    <p>It's important for the person to try each until they find a macor distribution they are comfortable with doing for long periods of time, but it can also be flexible by changing macro distributions after a week or two.</p>
        <h2>Daily Nutrient Needs</h2>
        <p>This section is for the recommended daily requirements of each essential nutrient, vitamins and minerals (macro and trace). Note that you don't need to hit all of the requirements at once in a single day, instead eat foods that contain nutrients you didn't get the day/s before this day to balance nutrient absorption.</p>
