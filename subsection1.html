        <h2>Types of Nutrition</h2>
        <p>According to Merriam-Webster, food is a material consisting essentially of protein, carbohydrate, and fat used in the body of an organism to sustain growth, repair, and vital processes and to furnish energy. What you eat is also a major deciding factor on the direction of where your physical health will go; being smart with food choices by eating clean and whole foods can maintain your body's wellbeing, whilst eating lots of processed foods may cause your health to lower. This page will be dedicated to inform users on how each nutrient matters to your body and where you could find them in foods.</p>

            <h3>Calories</h3>
            <p>Measurement of energy provided by food. Essential for fueling body, body functions and physical activity. Your body needs a certain amount daily to maintain weight, metabolism (and metabolic process) and energy balance. Increasing the daily calorie intake results in excess energy which your body stores (therefore weight and energy gain), and decreasing the daily intake will make your body burn fat as an alternative energy source (therefore weight loss).</p>
            <h3>Carbohydrates (4 kcal/g)</h3>
            <p>Your body's primary source of energy (unless you are in a keto diet, where you use ketogenics instead). Carbs can be seperated into two groups; simple carbohydrates (sugars) and complex carbohydrates (fibers, starches). Simple carbohydrates have simpler chemical structures and are digested quicker by our bodies, which makes your blood sugar count go higher but provide quick and easy energy for your body. Some are good for you (dairy and fruits) and some need to be controlled as they are not as healthy for you (candy, sugary drinks, fruit JUICE). Complex carbs, such as most vegetables, whole grains, beans and legumes, have more complex structures that your body takes longer to digest, which doesn't raise blood sugar while keeping you satiated for longer periods.</p>
            <h3>Proteins (4 kcal/g)</h3>
            <p>Another essential macronutrient composed of long chains of amino acids necessary for building and strengthening muscles, bones, cartilage, skin, and repairing cells and wounds. Vital for muscle repairing and growth, helping to retain muscle mass. Proteins are made up of 20 different amino acids, which are the building blocks of protein. Your body can produce some amino acids on its own, but others must be obtained through your diet. Protein is found in a variety of foods, including meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, legumes, nuts, and seeds. The recommended daily intake of protein varies depending on factors such as age. activity level, and overall health. For most adults, a general guideline is to consume about 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. However, athletes and individuals engaged in intense physical activity may require higher protein intake to support muscle recovery and growth.</p>
            <br><strong>Amino Acids</strong>: Amino Acids are molecules that result from digesting foods with protein and combine together to form proteins that help your body. Amino acids and protein are used together to grow muscle. Their effects include break down food, grow your body, repair body tissue and other bodily functions. They metabolize in your liver. Amino Acids are seperated into four main groups: Essential (important as our bodies benefit from these but can't produce them), Non-essential (not as important as our bodies need and are capable of producing on its own), Branched-chain amino acid (BCAAs; the three most important amino acids responsible for 40% of muscle strength and size growth) and Conditionally Essential (Non-essential unless in times of sickness and stress).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Essential Amino Acids: Histidine, Isoleucine, Leucine, Lysine, Methionine, Phenylalanine, Threonine, Tryptophan, Valine</li>
                <li>Non-essential Amino Acids: Alanine, Arginine, Asparagine, Aspartic Acid, Cysteine, Glutamic Acid, Glutamine, Glycine, Proline, Serine, Tyrosine</li>
                <li>Conditionally Essential Amino Acids: Arginine, Cysteine, Glutamine, Glycine, Proline, Serine</li>
                <li>Branched Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs): Leucine, Isoleucine, Valine</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Fats (9 kcal/g)</h3>
            <p>Fats are a macronutrient that is essential for your body to function properly. They are used as energy, help absorb vitamins, and are important for hormone production. Fats can be classified into three main types: saturated fats (solid at room temperature), unsaturated fats (liquid at room temperature), and trans fats (artificially created fats that are unhealthy for you). Fats are also classified into two groups: essential fatty acids (EFAs) and non-essential fatty acids. EFAs are important for your body to function properly, while non-essential fatty acids are not as important.</p>
            <h3>Vitamins & Minerals</h3>
            <p>Vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients that your body needs to function properly. They are important for maintaining good health, supporting the immune system, and preventing chronic diseases. Vitamins are organic compounds that are necessary for various bodily functions, while minerals are inorganic elements that play a role in many physiological processes. Vitamins and minerals can be obtained through a balanced diet that includes a variety of foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and dairy products.</p>
            <p>Vitamins are classified into two groups: water-soluble vitamins (B vitamins and vitamin C) and fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins A, D, E, and K). Water-soluble vitamins are not stored in the body and need to be consumed regularly, while fat-soluble vitamins can be stored in the body's fatty tissues.</p>
            <p>Minerals are classified into two groups: macrominerals (calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, potassium, chloride, and sulfur) and trace minerals (iron, manganese, copper, iodine, zinc, cobalt, fluoride, and selenium). Macrominerals are needed in larger amounts than trace minerals.</p>

            <h3>Dietary Fiber</h3>
            <p>Dietary fiber is a type of carbohydrate that the body cannot digest. It is found in plant-based foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds. Fiber is important for maintaining digestive health, regulating blood sugar levels, and reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. There are two types of dietary fiber: soluble fiber (dissolves in water) and insoluble fiber (does not dissolve in water). Soluble fiber can help lower cholesterol levels and regulate blood sugar levels, while insoluble fiber helps promote regular bowel movements.</p>
            <h3>Water</h3>
            <p>Provides water for your body, and brings nutrients to cells, getting rid of wastes, protecting joints and organs, and maintaining body temperature. It is recommended to drink at least 2 liters of water a day, but this can vary depending on your activity level, climate, and other factors.</p>
            </ul>
        <p>The factors are important for the body to function properly. The following is a list of the lesser factors that contribute to the quality and healthiness of the food (and the ones that contribute to other bodily functions):</p>

            <h3>Cholesterol</h3>
            <p>Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance found in every cell of the body. It is essential for the production of hormones, vitamin D, and bile acids that help digest fat. Cholesterol is carried through the bloodstream by lipoproteins, which are classified into two main types: low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). LDL cholesterol is often referred to as "bad" cholesterol because high levels can lead to the buildup of plaque in the arteries, increasing the risk of heart disease. HDL cholesterol is known as "good" cholesterol because it helps remove excess cholesterol from the bloodstream.</p>
            <h3>Electrolytes</h3>
            <p>Electrolytes are minerals in the body that carry an electric charge and are essential for various bodily functions, including maintaining fluid balance, regulating blood pressure, and supporting muscle and nerve function. The main electrolytes in the body include sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, bicarbonate, and phosphate. Electrolyte imbalances can occur due to dehydration, excessive sweating, certain medical conditions, or medications.</p>
            <h3>Antioxidants</h3>
            <p>Antioxidants are compounds that help protect the body from oxidative stress caused by free radicals. Free radicals are unstable molecules that can damage cells and contribute to aging and chronic diseases. Antioxidants neutralize free radicals and help prevent cellular damage. They are found in a variety of foods, particularly fruits and vegetables, and include vitamins C and E, selenium, and flavonoids.</p>
            <h3>Probiotics</h3>
            <p>Probiotics are live microorganisms that provide health benefits when consumed in adequate amounts. They are often referred to as "good" or "friendly" bacteria and are found in fermented foods such as yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, and kimchi. Probiotics help maintain a healthy balance of gut bacteria, support digestive health, and may boost the immune system.</p>
            <h3>Prebiotics</h3>
            <p>Prebiotics are non-digestible fibers that promote the growth and activity of beneficial gut bacteria. They serve as food for probiotics and help support a healthy gut microbiome. Prebiotics are found in foods such as garlic, onions, leeks, asparagus, bananas, and whole grains.</p>
            <h3>Omega-3 Fatty Acids</h3>
            <p>Omega-3 fatty acids are a type of polyunsaturated fat that is essential for overall health. They are important for brain function, heart health, and reducing inflammation in the body. Omega-3 fatty acids are found in fatty fish (such as salmon, mackerel, and sardines), flaxseeds, chia seeds, walnuts, and algae. There are three main types of omega-3 fatty acids: alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).</p>
            <p>Omega-3 fatty acids are important for various bodily functions, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Supporting brain health and cognitive function</li>
                <li>Reducing inflammation in the body</li>
                <li>Supporting heart health and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease</li>
                <li>Promoting healthy skin and hair</li>
                <li>Supporting joint health and reducing symptoms of arthritis</li>
                <li>Supporting eye health and reducing the risk of age-related macular degeneration</li>
                <li>Supporting immune function</li>
                <li>Supporting fetal development during pregnancy</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Omega-6 Fatty Acids</h3>
            <p>Omega-6 fatty acids are another type of polyunsaturated fat that is essential for overall health. They are important for brain function, skin health, and regulating metabolism. Omega-6 fatty acids are found in vegetable oils (such as corn oil, soybean oil, and sunflower oil), nuts, seeds, and poultry. There are two main types of omega-6 fatty acids: linoleic acid (LA) and arachidonic acid (AA).</p>
            <p>Omega-6 fatty acids are important for various bodily functions, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Supporting brain health and cognitive function</li>
                <li>Regulating metabolism and energy production</li>
                <li>Supporting skin health and reducing symptoms of eczema</li>
                <li>Supporting immune function</li>
                <li>Supporting reproductive health</li>
                <li>Supporting bone health</li>
                <li>Supporting joint health and reducing symptoms of arthritis</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Note</strong>: It is important to balance your body's intake ratio of Omega-3 and Omega-6 Fatty acids, as an Omega-6/Omega-3 Ratio under 1:1 or over 4:1 would promote the pathogenesis of multiple diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Therefore, it's important to have both types of fatty acids in your meals.</p>
