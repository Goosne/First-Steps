    <p class="intro-text">Dear reader,
        <br>
       First and foremost, I would like to thank you for choosing to open my website. I am trying my best to spread the true word about fitness and healthy living. I sincerely hope that you will find this website useful and informative. I have put a lot of effort into creating a comprehensive guide to fitness, nutrition, and overall well-being.
        <br>
       My name is Goosen Yan, a Grade 10 student who discovered his interest in the fitness industry two years prior to this website's creation. If you have any feedback for this website, please tell me in person or through my email "s1284893@stamfordamerican.edu.hk". Otherwise, have fun!
