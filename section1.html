    <h2 class="what">What is fitness?</h2>
    <p class="definition">Fitness is the condition of being physically fit and healthy and the quality of being suitable to fulfil a particular role or task. Fitness itself has many definitions, but in summary it means to be physically fit and healthy and that you are happy with it at the same time. Many understand "fitness" as being skinny or slim, while others think it's muscular and big.</p>
    <h2 class="why">Why is fitness important?</h2>
    <p class="importance">Fitness is important for a number of reasons. It helps to maintain a healthy weight, reduces the risk of chronic diseases, improves mental health, and enhances overall quality of life. Regular physical activity can also boost energy levels, improve sleep quality, and increase longevity. Physical activity or exercise for at least 30 minutes helps with burning calories, reducing body fat and weight, and raising blood flow, therefore oxygen levels, which helps with reducing chances for cancer, heart diseases and diabetes. It also helps with reducing body blood glucose (sugar) levels and insulin (preventing diabetes and metabolic syndrome), blood pressure and triglyceride levels, helps manage chronic conditions, improve critical thinking, cognitive skills, mood, mental health, strengthens bones and muscles and even improves sexual health. These are just a few of important reasons.</p>
    <h2 class="how">Factors</h2>
    <p class="factors">There are many factors that can affect fitness, including:
        <ul>
            <li>Nutrition Adequacy: A balanced diet that provides the necessary nutrients and energy for physical activity.</li>
            <li>Physical Activity: Regular exercise and movement that challenges the body and promotes cardiovascular health.</li>
            <li>Hydration: Adequate water intake to support bodily functions and performance.</li>
            <li>Rest and Recovery: Sufficient sleep and recovery time to allow the body to repair and rebuild.</li>
            <li>Genetics: Genetic predisposition can influence body composition, metabolism, and fitness levels.</li>
            <li>Age: As we age, our bodies may require different types of exercise and recovery.</li>
            <li>Mental Wellbeing: Mental health and stress management can impact motivation and performance.</li>
            <li>Environment: Access to facilities, safe spaces for exercise, and social support can influence fitness levels.</li>
            <li>Lifetyle: Lifestyle choices, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and sedentary behavior, can affect overall fitness.</li>
            <li>Consistency and Commitment: some say they lack motivation, but they really lack discipline. Motivation is a short term desire to to something, and Discipline is the mentality to continuously drive you to repeatedly do something.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>How to lose weight effectively?</h2>
    <p>If you are looking at this section, then you must be either curious, bored or want to achieve certain goals in your life quickly. Unless you are a pro athlete under strict regulations or some other organization absolutely requiring you to be at a certain weight, then you should focus on gaining muscle and losing fat over losing weight. To put into perspective, if you only focus on losing weight, undergoing strict diets immediately, doing lots of cardio everyday, then after sometime you would probably quit due to the difficulty, or you become really really skinny or you just become a scaled down version of your current self after a year or two. It works, but the process and results aren't the best, so unless a marathon runner's physique is your desired physique, it's easier if you . If you focus on losing body fat and gaining muscle, decreasing your daily calorie intake slowly over time, incorporating weight training into your daily excersizes, then not only can you lose fat and slim down over time, you become stronger, more physically enduring and look more balanced as the excess fat in your body becomes replaced by muscles. Of course, this doesn't mean you would look very muscular, it just means you look more fit (it's a common misconception to think a bit of weight training makes you look jacked; to look like a pro bodybuilder takes years of heavy weight training).</p>
    <p>Benefits of gaining muscle:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Increased metabolism: Muscle burns more calories at rest than fat, so having more muscle can help you maintain a healthy weight.</li>
        <li>Improved strength and endurance: Building muscle can enhance your physical performance and make daily activities easier.</li>
        <li>Better body composition: Gaining muscle while losing fat can lead to a more toned and defined appearance.</li>
        <li>Enhanced bone health: Weight-bearing exercises that build muscle also strengthen bones, reducing the risk of osteoporosis.</li>
        <li>Improved insulin sensitivity: Muscle helps regulate blood sugar levels, reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes.</li>
        <li>Increased energy levels: Regular strength training can boost your overall energy and reduce fatigue.</li>
        <li>Better mental health: Exercise, including strength training, releases endorphins that can improve mood and reduce stress.</li>
        </ul>
    <p class="lose-weight"><br>To lose weight effectively, it's important to create a calorie deficit (250-500 less calories than BMR, up to 1000 less for extreme dieters which is not recommended at all for regular teens, adults or athletes) by consuming fewer calories than you burn, maintaining weight means to eat the exact amount of calories you burn per day (Basal Metabolic Rate), and gaining weight means to eat in a calorie surplus (250-500 more calories than BMR, some can go up to 1000 more calories) This can be achieved through a combination of diet and exercise. Here are some tips:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stay consistent.</strong> It's hard not to stress this with beginners, but doing something just once and going back to where you started doesn't change anything in fitness.</li>
            <li>Eat a balanced diet rich in whole foods, including fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains.</li>
            <li>Monitor portion sizes and avoid overeating.</li>
            <li>Incorporate regular physical activity into your routine, including both cardiovascular and strength training exercises.</li>
            <li>Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Avoid sugary drinks and high-calorie snacks.</li>
            <li>Clear misconceptions of 'healthy foods/healthier replacements' by carefully reading through the nutrition label (example: dark chocolate despite less sugar/carbs actually has more fat than milk chocolate)</li>
            <li>Get enough sleep to support weight loss efforts.</li>
            <li>Eat/Drink zero sugar or healthier replacement products to suppress sweet tooth and apetite (mints, gum, coke zero, fruits, etc in moderation).</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="lose-weight">Remember that weight loss is a gradual process, and it's important to set realistic goals and be patient with yourself. It's also advisable to consult with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian before making significant changes to your diet or exercise routine.</p>
