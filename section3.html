        <h2>Training</h2>
        <p class="training">Training is a crucial aspect of fitness and bodybuilding. It involves a structured program of physical exercises designed to improve strength, endurance, flexibility, and overall fitness. As mentioned in the <a href="section1.html">Fitness</a> page, physical activity for at least 30 minutes can be very beneficial to your health by raising blood flow, burning calories, reducing chances of getting diseases (such as type 2 diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular issues and others), etc. Different types of training are available to target different groups of people. An example being bodybuilder training for those who want big muscles, calisthenics for those who want to master body weight excersizes, specified training for different sports, etc. For instance, Training and running for longer periods of time increases your aerobic capacity (lung/O2 capacity) and Lactate Threshold (lactic acid hits you slower meaning slower sense of fatigue). <a href="https://musclewiki.com/">This website</a> has lists of many workouts for each muscle group for home workouts and gym workouts. Running more allows your body to adapt to the stress during training and your muscles start to adapt as well. You also build mental resilience over time. These are the key aspects of most training techniques:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Types of Training:</strong> There are various types of training, including strength training, cardiovascular training, flexibility training, and functional training.</li>
            <li><strong>Progressive Overload:</strong> To build muscle and strength, it's important to gradually increase the weight or resistance used in your workouts.</li>
            <li><strong>Rest and Recovery:</strong> Allowing your muscles to recover is essential for growth. Ensure you have rest days in your training program.</li>
            <li><strong>Nutrition:</strong> Proper nutrition supports your training goals. Fuel your body with the right nutrients before and after workouts.</li>
            <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Consistency is key to achieving fitness goals. Stick to your training program and make it a regular part of your routine.</li>
            <li><strong>Hypertrophy:</strong> Hypertrophy is the terminology for muscle growth. It is achieved through Muscle Fiber Damage (stretch and tiny tears, not completely tearing), satellite cell activation, protein synthesis (rate increases post workouts) and through the influence of your hormones. Strength developed over time after progressive overloading (increasing the weights you lift overtime) and increased muscle fiber size. Resilience increases after adapting to your long term training which also means your body would recover from soreness faster.
            <br>Hypertrophy is split into two parts:</li>
            <br><strong>Myofibrillar Hypertrophy</strong>: Myofibrillar hypertrophy is the increase in the size and density of myofibrils, which are the contractile units of muscle fibers. This type of hypertrophy is associated with strength gains and is typically achieved through heavy lifting and lower repetitions (1-6 reps).
            <br><strong>Sarcoplasmic Hypertrophy</strong>: Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is the increase in the volume of sarcoplasm, the semi-fluid substance surrounding myofibrils in muscle fibers. This type of hypertrophy is associated with increased endurance and is typically achieved through higher repetitions (8-15 reps) and moderate weights.</li>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="types">Types of Training</h2>
        <p class="types">There are several types of training, each with its own focus and benefits. Here are some common types of training:</p>
        <ul class="types">
            <li><strong>Bodybuilding Training:</strong> Bodybuilding training is designed to increase muscle size and definition. It typically involves a combination of strength training and nutrition strategies.
            <br>General muscle growth (hypertrophy) is split into three parts:</li>
            <br><strong>Cutting</strong>: Cutting is the bodybuilding phase that involves losing a lot of body fat while also trying to preserve as much muscle as possible. This is achieved through a Calorie Deficit (eating around 250-500 less calories than your maintenance calories, which is your BMR). Your macrosâ€™ ratio during a cut should be lowered by a little (could be the same percentage as your maintenance calories). Once the desired Body Fat Percentage or weight is achieved you should start gradually increase back your maintenance calories to maintain. This is very effective in losing fat and weight, but not very effective in muscle growth. During cuts, you are to do around 30 minutes of cardio post workout to burn extra calories and fat. Compared to Body Recomp, this approach is a bit more extreme.
            <br><strong>Bulking</strong>: Bulking is the opposite of cutting. It focuses mostly on gaining muscle and strength while controlling the amount of fat you gain at the same time. This is achieved through a calorie surplus (eating 250-500 calories over your maintenance calories), which provides enough energy for your body to push those heavier weights while also growing your muscle. There are two ways to bulk; Lean bulk (eating whole foods and controlling the amount of junk food and excess fat you get) and Dirty bulking (you eat way over your maintenance calories with mostly junk food and a lot of excess nutrition). This is excellent for muscle and weight growth but bad for losing fat and weight. 
            <br>Once the desired weight is achieved you should start gradually decrease/increase back your maintenance calories to maintain. During bulking, you are to do around 30 minutes of cardio post workout to burn extra calories and fat. Compared to Cutting, this approach is a bit more extreme.
            <br><strong>Body Recomp</strong>: Body Recomposition (Recomping) refers to simultaneously gaining muscle while losing fat (weight) at the same time. This is a slower yet safer approach compared to the other two I will talk about. This requires meticulous attention to nutrition, training, and recovery. This approach focuses more on body composition more than solely on fat loss, weight loss or muscle gain. Body recomp is used to make your body first prepared for fat loss while gaining muscle at the same time. Compared to the other two, this is ok at gaining muscle, losing fat and losing weight.</li>
            <br><br><li><strong>Strength Training:</strong> This type of training focuses on building muscle strength and size through resistance exercises, such as weightlifting.</li>
